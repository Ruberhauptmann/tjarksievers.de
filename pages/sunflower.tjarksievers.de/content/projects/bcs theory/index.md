The BCS theory, named after Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer, explains how electron pairs, known as Cooper pairs, form in a superconductor and enable it to conduct electricity without resistance. This groundbreaking theory is fundamental to the understanding of superconductivity and has had a profound impact on condensed matter physics.
