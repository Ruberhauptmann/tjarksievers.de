\section{Classical Statistical Mechanics}
Statistical mechanics links the microscopic properties of atoms and molecules to the macroscopic observable properties of materials, such as temperature and pressure.

\section{Thermodynamic Potentials}
Thermodynamic potentials like the Helmholtz free energy and Gibbs free energy provide insights into system behavior under different constraints.

\begin{equation}
F = U - TS
\end{equation}

\section{Phase Transitions}
Phase transitions, such as the transition from liquid to gas, are described by changes in the free energy as a function of temperature or other external parameters.

\section{Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem}
The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates the response of a system to small external forces to the fluctuations occurring in the system at equilibrium.
