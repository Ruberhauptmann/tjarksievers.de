title = "Lecture Notes"
+++

This is a collection of lecture notes I created from lectures I attended while studying physics at University Hamburg.
The content is compiled from the lecture content as well as recommended reading material.
Everything is a work in progress, as I am not able to update these lectures notes while I take the lectures.
I don't guarantee factual correctness in any of the notes, everything is written to the best of my knowledge.
