When I started my bachelor project, the group of Professor Wehling was starting pretty fresh at the university.
The project we ended up on was to look at [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), one of the DFT software packages used in the group and see how it runs best on our local compute cluster.

I did a lot of calulcations and learned how to work with a big software package like Quantum Espresso.
Overall I'm pretty happy with how the thesis turned out, but in retrospect I wish I would have started earlier with the final calculations and actually analyse some interesting physics and not just work with computational aspects.
