In summary, my bachelor project was about a software package used in the research group and how to best run it on our local compute cluster.

When I started my bachelor project, the group of Professor Wehling was starting pretty fresh at the university.
The project we ended up on was to look at [Quantum Espresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/), evaluating how it runs best on our local compute cluster
Quantum Espresso is a software package implementing Density Functional Theory (DFT), which is a very successful method to calculate electronic properties of materials.
I did a lot of simple calculations on silicon to see how well the code runs on the Physnet cluster with different compilers, on different ressources, etc.
In the end I also calculated on a material called Tantalum(IV) sulfide in a 2-dimensional layer.
