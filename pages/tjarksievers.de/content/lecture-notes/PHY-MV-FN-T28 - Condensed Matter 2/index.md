This course covers a range of topics in condensed-matter theory.
It is a graduate-level course, as such a background in undergraduate physics (especially lectures in theoretical physics covering quantum mechanics and statistical physics) is required.
A lecture covering basic topics in condensed-matter theory (crystal structure, non-interacting electrons in a solid, band structure) may also be useful.

Topics:

* “More is different”: Interaction effects in condensed matter
* Magnetism & superconductivity
* Green functions & diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory
* Path integrals in quantum many-body physics
* Spontaneous symmetry breaking and collective phenomena
