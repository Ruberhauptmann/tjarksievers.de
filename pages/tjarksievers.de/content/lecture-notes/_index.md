title = "Lecture Notes"

This is a collection of lecture notes I created from lectures I heard while studying physics.
The content is compiled from the lecture content as well as recommended reading material.
Everything is a work in progress, as I am not able to update these lectures notes while I take the lectures.
I don't guarantee factual correctness in any of the notes, everything is written to the best of my knowledge.
