I was quite happy with myself this week. Got back into preparing oatmeal two times a week, which gives me a something to eat in the morning as well as the afternoon and makes me feel so much better compared to going hungry or buying snacks somewhere on campus.

I had to make my first project report for the Computational Physics class, the professor was pretty happy with that! My next task there is to understand numeric integration via Gaussian quadrature, I still need to do that this weekend.

The last two weeks I worked hard on four exercise sheets and sent them in, which means that for two of my three courses this semester the first half of the required exercises are done, so I have a bit more of a relaxed time until the beginning of December (I still need to do them, I just don't need to send them in, and preparing them to send them in is always a big part of the total workforce).
