I saw Cavetown this week!

I noticed how much I already am back in a rhythm that works for me, because last weeks there were some points that broke that routine and consequently threw me out of some good habits I picked up before (like, I had to leave earlier one day, so I didn't prepare my overnight oats, but then because of that I didn't have them for the next day where I would have needed them).

Next week will be much more regular, it's gonna be the first week with all regular lectures and exercises.
