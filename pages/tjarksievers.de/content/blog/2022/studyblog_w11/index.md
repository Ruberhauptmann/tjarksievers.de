I had a good few days with my family over christmas, still did a little bit of uni work, because I always get a bit uneasy when I have this stark contrast of going from a super high stress situation to doing nothing. Was mostly working through some old lectures. 

All in all I would say I'm pretty good on course for the things I want to finish during the Christmas break, will evaluate that next week.
