I was still on vacation in the beginning of the week, so I didn't do a lot beyond a watching the lectures on Monday and preparing the exercise sheet for topology. I somehow really got myself into stress about exams now, that dominated the last few days a bit. They are still a bit away, but still, getting stressed about preparation there.
