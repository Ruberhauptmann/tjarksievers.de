Unfortunately I caught a mean cold at the new years party I attended, so I spent the last few days sick in bed. Still did a bit of Uni work, submitted two exercises for the Computational physics class and worked through some exercise problems and lectures for the quantum field theory class. All in all quite satisfied with everything I was able to do despite the circumstances. Also thankful to have some (forced) resting time, as the whole of January will be quite stressful.
