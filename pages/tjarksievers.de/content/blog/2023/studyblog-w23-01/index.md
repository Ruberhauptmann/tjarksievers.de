This semester is the last one before my master thesis, and all I gotta do are some credits in elective courses. I chose a lecture about anthropogenic accidents and one about working with data.

I also have some presentations in group seminars, I thought this might be a good use of my time, just really getting into some specific topics and practicing my presentation skills a bit.
