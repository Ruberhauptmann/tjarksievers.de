Unfortunately I caught a mean cold at the new years party I attended, so I spent the last few days sick in bed. Still did a bit of Uni work, submitted two exercises for the Computational physics class and worked through some exercise problems and lectures for the quantum field theory class. All in all quite satisfied with everything I was able to do despite the circumstances. Also thankful to have some (forced) resting time, as the whole of January will be quite stressful.

I was ill the first week of the semester, so I didn't get around to make a post for that, and I also didn't really have the time to take pictures of my time studying this week. So those will return next week! For now I wanted to give a little overview of what I am up to this semester. I got 3 big physics modules this semester:
- Topology in condensed matter physics: A very maths heavy lecture covering the foundations of the mathematical field of topology as well as applications in all kinds of condensed matter systems. This is very interesting for me, as my master thesis will probably fall in this area of physics. 
- Quantum Computing and Information: This is an experimental lecture on the theory behind and the realisation of quantum computers. We will have possibility to calculate on a quantum computing platform in the exercises, which I think is super exciting!
- Quantum technologies 2: This is part of a series on all kinds of technologies enabled by quantum physics. I hope to get a very broad overview of how the quantum effects I learn about are applied in real life technological applications and labs.

Furthermore the Friday for Future group at our University is organising a lecture series which I also attend.
