This week I worked through more theory for the talks in the group seminars I'm attending. The one on Dec 6th is already coming very close, but I'm slowly getting a grip of Mott insulators.

Also I spent a lot of time working on a project for work. Its a website for distributing hardware to the research groups and I just got a lot into polishing the UI, using tailwindcss. Its a lot of fun, just seeing how I can make things look nice and uniform across the website.
