Currently there is a lot to do at my workplace, because all the deliveries of new devices are coming in, so I need to put them all into inventory, which took up a lot of time. Because of that, I still feel behind on study materials for the exams, but I still can follow the content of all lectures and also still at least some of my exercise sheets, so its mostly a thing of "if I did those things I would have a more chill time before the exams" and not a "I'm absolutely not following this at the moment" like it was last semester at some times.
