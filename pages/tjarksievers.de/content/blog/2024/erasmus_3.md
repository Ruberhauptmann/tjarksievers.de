Two weeks ago, my supervisors and I talked and we set up my topic some more, and I started looking at papers and ressources to get a grasp of everything.
I think this is a good opportunity to present three areas that define the corner stones of my work.

# Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) 

DMFT is a computational method in theoretical condensed-matter physics with a very successful track record in the last years.
It is one of the ways we currently have to treat the problem of interacting electrons in solid-state physics.
Many basic effects in solid-state physics can be explained with electrons that are not or just barely interacting with each other.
But there is a plethora of phenomena that cannot, and the fact that electrons actually repel each other (because they are negatively charged).
We are just starting to be able to treat this problem of interacting electrons, especially for real materials.

# Superconductivity, Finite-Momentum Pairing

Superconductivity is the effect

The microscopic mechanism behind superconductivity

# Graphene

Graphene is the name given to the structure of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.
It was first produced and identified in 2004 and started a lot of work in the field of 2-dimensional materials.
One very interesting aspect of Graphene that has sparked research in recent years is the fact, that two stacked layers, 

This kind of configuration will probably be an 

My supervisor in Germany is an expert in Graphene, he published a lot in the area when he did his PhD work in the 2010s and my Swedish supervisor also published some works on the special superconducting properties of Graphene.
For now, it's not quite clear how much I will do in Graphene, but it is definitely the goal to explore the material in this context, because it brings the strengths of the two research groups together: a knowlegde of what kinds of unconventional superconductivity appear in simpler models and the knowledge about materials and large-scale computations.
