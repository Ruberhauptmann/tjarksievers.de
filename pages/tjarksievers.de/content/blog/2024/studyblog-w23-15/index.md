This week I got sick again... I sadly had to cancel my talk because of that, its a bit sad all the preparation was for nothing now, but I still learned a lot during it, so its all fine. Also I'm not dependent on the credits, so I could just tell the professor we dont need to find another date in the semester break to repeat it.

But I played a lot of Stardew Valley while sick and also read a lot, that was super nice!
