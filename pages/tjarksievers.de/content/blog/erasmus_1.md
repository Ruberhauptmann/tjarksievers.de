This series will outline my experience doing my master's thesis in physics as a collaboration between a research group in my home country of Germany and a Swedish group.

I think I will also sprinkle in some deeper dives into my topic and the work I do day to day, so maybe I can also get some of that across.

I hope you follow me on my journey!
